        <h2>Here's a timeline of Al-Khwarizmi's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class='bold'>780 CE</span> - Born in Khwarazm (modern-day Uzbekistan), part of the Abbasid Caliphate.</li>
          <li><span class='bold'>800 CE</span> - Moves to Baghdad, the intellectual heart of the Islamic Golden Age, and becomes part of the House of Wisdom, a renowned academy for scholars.</li>
          <li><span class='bold'>820 CE</span> - Writes "Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala" (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing), introducing the foundational principles of algebra. This book gives the field its name: "al-jabr."</li>
          <li><span class='bold'>825 CE</span> - Authors "Zij al-Sindhind", a comprehensive astronomical and trigonometric text based on Hindu and Greek sources, advancing the study of celestial mechanics.</li>
          <li><span class='bold'>830 CE</span> - Produces works that popularize the Hindu-Arabic numeral system (including the concept of zero) in the Islamic world, which later influences European mathematics.</li>
          <li><span class='bold'>840 CE</span> - Writes on geography, revising Ptolemyâ€™s work and creating one of the most accurate maps of the known world at the time. His book, "Kitab Surat al-Ard" (The Image of the Earth), becomes a reference for centuries.</li>
          <li><span class='bold'>12th century CE</span> - Al-Khwarizmi's works are translated into Latin, introducing his name as "Algoritmi," a term that evolves into "algorithm," essential to modern computer science.</li>
          <li><span class='bold'>Legacy</span> - Al-Khwarizmi's contributions provide the framework for solving quadratic equations and influence fields as diverse as mathematics, astronomy, geography, and engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          "Muhammad Al-Khwarizmi's innovations were revolutionary. His algebra not only provided a new way to solve problems but laid the groundwork for all modern mathematical sciences. He was, indeed, a pioneer of logic and calculation."
